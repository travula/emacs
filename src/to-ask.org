* Introduction
  The problems encountered in customizing emacs with the
  base taken from Venkatesh are listed here. 
* Load path of elpa packages
  How are the elpa packages loaded.  =load-path= does not

  this?  It does

* User Defined Tags
  User defined tags are getting loaded initially.  The fix
  is to load =org= before the tags are set.
